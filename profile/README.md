- Go to list of contents and look for existing topics. If you want to contribute to an existing topic, go to the specific folder.
- If you want to create new topic, just add the topic code to the list of contents table and then create a subfolder for that.
- For instance, if you want to create new topic about oracles just add ORACLE to the topic column, ORCL to the code column, Oracles and its features.. to the discussion column.  
- The topic should be all BOLD characters like NFTS, ORACLE etc....
- The code should be either three or four letter word which will resemble the topic. Also, the code should be a link that redirects to the assicated sub-folder.
