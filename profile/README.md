## How to contribute guide

> Please follow the below instructions on how to contribute to the repository

- Each topic contains a code associated with it. For example to contribute to general topics you can go to GEN-XXXX. Here GEN indicates GENERAL and XXXX indicates topic code.

**How to create new Topic**

- Go to list of contents and look for existing topics. If you want to contribute to an existing topic, go to the specific folder.
- If you want to create new topic, just add the topic code to the list of contents table and then create a subfolder for that.
- For instance, if you want to create new topic about oracles just add ORACLE to the topic column, ORCL to the code column, Oracles and its features.. to the discussion column.  
- The topic should be all BOLD characters like NFTS, ORACLE etc....
- The code should be either three or four letter word which will resemble the topic. Also, the code should be a link that redirects to the assicated sub-folder.
- The discussion column should contain brief overview what you are trying to educate people on.

**How to create a new topic article**

> Topic aticles are each topics specific information 

- If you want to create new topic in general, then go to GEN sub-folder and add the topic discussion as GEN-lastNumber + 1.
- For example, when you want to the GEN sub-folder and want to create new topic, then just create new file.md which should be named GEN-<last article number> + 1.
